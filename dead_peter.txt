Hi. I'm Peter.
I'm dead.
Don't worry. It happens.
Do you know my Uncle Abe? He's alive. You'll meet him tonight.
Do you know Betsy? Uncle Abe's dinosaur. For real. She's alive, too. Uncle Abe says that she's older than he is, but she seems young to me.
But I guess just because you're alive doesn't mean you know everyone. It's not like a small club.
Who else â€” let's see.
Some musicians.
A biologist.
A fly. He's got only 24 hours to live.
I feel close to him.
Some flowers.
A bunch of other people.
It's kind of cool being dead. Being alive was confusing for me. Being dead is so certain. It sounds funny. Dead Peter. I got here. It's final. That's that. Dead Peter.
